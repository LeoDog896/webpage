When I was redoing this website (for the. fifth time? I don't know. I haven't touched it since high school) I was reminded of a few issues:

- YYYY-MM-DD is clearly the best date format
- [`Rehype Pretty Code`](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/) does not play well with mdsvex (and I didn't want to fix it. Again.)
- I refuse to use BunJS as a moral imperative.
- I haven't used Svelte since Svelte v5 came out. (This is a slight lie, as I have used it for about 5 minutes before this.)
- I haven't written a blog post in a year and a half.

Hm. Shame.
